This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The problem arises when you try to apply Tailwind classes to elements that are dynamically rendered or added to the DOM after the initial render.  Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler may not detect these elements, leading to the classes being ignored. For example, if you have a component that dynamically adds list items, the Tailwind classes applied to those items may not take effect.
